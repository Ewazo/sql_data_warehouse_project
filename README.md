# sql_data_warehouse_project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.

### Project Overview

This is a comprehensive, hands-on project that guides you through the process of building a **modern data warehouse** from scratch. Using a detailed case study based on a retail company, I learned to apply core data engineering principles to create a scalable and efficient data solution. The project is designed to be a significant addition to professional portfolios, showcasing ability to design, develop, and maintain a data warehouse.

### Technologies Used

* **SQL Server**: The primary database environment for this project. All data storage, transformation logic, and final models are built using SQL Server.
* **SQL**: The foundational language used throughout the project for data manipulation, cleaning, and modeling.
* **Data Modeling Concepts**: This project applies industry-standard data modeling techniques, such as star schema and dimensional modeling, to optimize the warehouse for business intelligence and reporting.

### Project Scope and Milestones

The project is broken down into a series of logical milestones.

**Phase 1: Project Scoping and Architecture Design**: 
This initial phase involves understanding the business requirements of the retail company. Definition of key business metrics, identification of the data sources, and design of high-level data architecture, including tables and their relationships. This step is critical for ensuring the final warehouse meets the company's analytical needs.

**Phase 2: Data Extraction and Integration**: 
This project simulates extracting data from various source systems. SQL scripts are written to integrate this disparate data into a single, unified staging area. This phase focuses on handling multiple data formats and ensuring data consistency.

**Phase 3: Data Transformation and Quality Control**: 
Here, a dive deep into data cleaning and transformation is conducted. Complex SQL queries to handle common data issues like missing values is carried out, duplicates, and inconsistent data types are handled. This phase ensures the data is clean and reliable before it's loaded into the final warehouse. 

**Phase 4: Dimensional Modeling**: 
This is the core of the project. The final dimensional model is built, creating **fact tables** (which store measures like sales) and **dimension tables** (which store contextual attributes like product or customer information). This structure is essential for enabling fast and flexible analytical queries.

**Phase 5: Finalization and Documentation**: 
The final phase involves documenting the entire data pipeline and ensuring the warehouse is ready for use by business analysts.
